	</synopsis>
	
	<description> <p>ifmetric is a Linux tool for setting the metrics of all
	  IPv4 routes attached to a given network interface at once. This
	  may be used to change the priority of routing IPv4 traffic over
	  the interface. Lower metrics correlate with higher
	  priorities.</p>

      <p>ifmetric uses the Linux NETLINK interface to manipulate the
     routes. Because of that it is compatible with routes created with
     the new iproute2 utility.</p>
    </description>
	
	<options>

	  <p>You should specify the interface name as first parameter. The
	  second parameter should be the new metric. If ommited the metric
	  0 (highest) is used.</p>
