Overview

   ifmetric is a Linux tool for setting the metrics of all IPv4 routes
   attached to a given network interface at once. This may be used to
   change the priority of routing IPv4 traffic over the interface. Lower
   metrics correlate with higher priorities.

Status

   Version 0.3 is stable and feature complete.

Documentation

  ifmetric's purpose

   Sometimes two network interfaces of different speeds with equal routes
   are available at the same time. (e.g. a laptop with both a wireless
   and a copper LAN card) The one with the greater througput should be
   preferred over the other. To achieve this, you may use the route's
   metric field. Routes with lower metrics are preferred over those with
   higher. Unfortunately many network configurators (like DHCP clients)
   do not support to set the metric for a route. ifmetric may be used to
   manipulate the metrics of routes a posteriori. The default metric for
   a route in the Linux kernel is 0, meaning the highest priority.

   ifmetric makes use of the NETLINK interface of the Linux kernel for
   manipulating the routes. Thus, ifmetric is compatible with complex
   routes created with iproute2.

   ifmetric doesn't modify the routes atomically. The is due to the
   NETLINK API. However, this should not hurt since ifmetric makes sure
   that not routes are ever lost while modifying them.

  Usage

   Have a look on the manual page [14]ifmetric(8).

   To give all other interfaces a higher priority than wlan0 simply run:
ifmetric wlan0 1

   To reset the metrics of the routes attached to wlan0 simply run:
ifmetric wlan0 0

Requirements

   A newer Linux Kernel supporting the NETLINK API. (I think 2.2 is good
   enough).

   ifmetric was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   August 2003, it should work on most other Linux distributions since it
   uses GNU autoconf for source code configuration.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of ifmetric.

   The Linux kernel headers have to be available during compilation.

Acknowledgements

   For the developers of iproute2 and zebra, since I looked on their
   source codes for learning how to use NETLINK.
